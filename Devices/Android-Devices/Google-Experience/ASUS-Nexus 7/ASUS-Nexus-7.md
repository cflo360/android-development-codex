The ASUS Nexus 7 is Google's first official tablet, sold at an amazing cut-rate price of $200, yet packed with the most powerful hardware in town.

As a Nexus device, modding is straightforward and simple, and everything is based on the rock solid foundation of the Android Open Source Project. There is also no lag in updates from carrier shenanigans.

## Unlock, Recovery, and Root

* [[Nexus Drivers]] - Set up your device to work with ADB.
* [[Nexus Toolkits]] - The easy, one-click root. Great for noobs who want to get it done quickly and easily.
* [[Nexus Manual Method]] - While one-click root/unlock programs exist and are *perfectly safe to use*, take advantage of the great opportunity to understand more by using the manual method; few other devices are as straightforward or forgiving.
* [[Nexus Restore]] - Got any problems, or need to send your device back for repair? Just restore it to stock.

## Other Mods

* [XDA-Developers - Fix for no sound in one ear on Headphone Jack](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2432076) - When you use the headphone jack on the Nexus 7, does the music only play out of one ear, instead of both? The problem lies in the poor insulation between the headphone jack and the conductive back case. Just put some electrical tape on the part where the back case covers over the jack, and it's fixed!

## Miscellaneous

* [[Ubuntu on Nexus 7|N7 Ubuntu]] - Because of it's ubiquity and low price, the Nexus 7 is being used as Ubuntu's ARM reference device. You can install it to your little tablet with the click of a button.
* [[N7 Sources]] - All the guides we've sourced and all the people to thank.
