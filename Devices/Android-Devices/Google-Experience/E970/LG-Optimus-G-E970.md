The AT&T LG Optimus G E970 has exactly the same hardware as the Nexus 4, but adds an SDCard slot and LTE support. It can even be reflashed to accept Nexus 4 ROMs. 

Best of all, it could be found in mint condition on eBay for only $150, far less than the more popular Nexus 4. The GSM SIM unlock costs just $10.

In this guide, you too can turn an LGOG into a Nexus 4 with LTE and an SDCard slot.
