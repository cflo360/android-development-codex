FreeGee is an app that will automatically install custom recovery and unlock the bootloader. This is the safest and noob-friendly method.

1. Install LG USB Drivers
2. Enable USB Debugging and plug in phone
3. Root the phone using the [toolkit](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2084528&d=1372717878) (provide manual method too)
4. Then use the FreeGee app to install CWM/TWRP and disable LG security.
