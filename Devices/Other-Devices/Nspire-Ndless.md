Ndless is a system that allows the use of C or assembly programs on the Nspire, unlocking it's full potential.

## Install Computer Link

If you don't already have the software that came with your Nspire, download and install the [TI-Nspire Computer Link](http://education.ti.com/en/us/products/computer_software/connectivity-software/ti-nspire-computer-link-software/features/features-summary) for free from TI.

## If using OS 3.2.3 and lower

> **Note:** OS 3.2.4 cannot be downgraded using this method.

Unfortunately, Ndless does not work on OS 3.2.x. 

On the other hand, we can just downgrade to OS 3.1 to get Ndless. TI did not restrict downgrades to 3.1 for some unknown reason. We hypothesize that it was an escape route in case of bugs.

1. Go to the [TI-Planet OS archive](http://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_list.php?id=OS+Nspire) and download a **v.3.1** file with the name of your calculator model.
2. Open the TI-Nspire Computer Link software, connect your calculator, and drag-and-drop the downloaded file to your Nspire.
3. The program will prompt you to update. Just follow the instructions.

1. Download and extract the [Ndless installer](http://www.unsads.com/projects/nsptools/downloader/download/release/1). 

2. Open the TI-Nspire Computer Link software, and connect your calculator. Ignore any update dialogs.

3. Create a new folder called `ndless` inside your calculator.

4. In the link software, open the folder where you extracted the installer to, and enter the `calcbin` folder.

5. From the `calcbin` folder, copy the `ndless_resources.tns` file to the  calculator's `ndless` folder.

{{Warning|Do not remove `ndless_resources.tns` from the calculator without uninstalling Ndless.}}

6. Find your model in the list below. From the `calcbin` folder, copy over the update file with the corresponding file extension to install Ndless.

* `.tno` - classic TI-Nspire (Clickpad/Touchpad)
* `.tnc` - classic TI-Nspire CAS
* .`tco` - TI-Nspire CX
* `.tcc` - TI-Nspire CX CAS

7. There will be an error on the computer while installing; just ignore it.

8. The calculator will give you a dialog box telling you that Ndless was successfully installed. You can now load Ndless apps to your Nspire.

## Uninstall Ndless

1. On your calculator, go to `My Documents` and enter the `ndless` folder.
2. Launch the `ndless_resources.tns` program, and click **Yes** to uninstall Ndless.
