The TI-Nspire is a graphing calculator heavily updated for a world in the smartphone age. For one, it's not just another 30-year old Z80 design; the CX models sport a powerful 150MHz ARM processor, equal to the Pocket PCs of old.

However, it's true power is hidden behind a wave of security controls and some ineffectual BASIC and Lua scripts. This guide is about installing Ndless and trying out a wave of emulators, programs, scripts, all kinds of things to get you through Calculus class without sleeping.

This guide works with both the original TI-Nspire and the improved CX version. Just note that the CX calcs will be more practical for CPU intensive or color apps like emulators.

### Ndless

> **Note:** _Your calculator must be at firmware version 3.6 or less to install Ndless 3.1._

* [[Ndless 3.6|Nspire Ndless 3.6]] - Ndless enables allows custom apps to be run on the TI-Nspire using traditional programming languages, like any decent computer. Ndless 3.6 is the latest version, for OS 3.6 and lower. (OS 3.9 is not supported or downgradable yet)
  * [[Ndless 3.1|Nspire Ndless 3.1]] - Ndless 3.1 is the legacy version of Ndless. It is meant for OS 3.2.3 and lower.
* [Ndless SDK](http://ndless.me/) - Ndless also provides a nice SDK for developers to work in, packing a nice emulator to boot.
* [[Nspire Linux]] - A small build of embedded ARM Linux created with Buildroot. Works quite nicely, though apps have to be cross-compiled with buildroot.

### TI-Nspire CX (Color screen)

* [[Nlaunch CX 3.6/3.1]] - Dual-boot your Nspire into both OS 3.6 and 3.1 with this OS switcher. It bypasses all known OS protections on the Nspire. 
  * [[Nlaunch CX 3.2/3.1]] - The legacy version of Nlaunch, for dual-booting 3.2 and 3.1.

### TI-Nspire (non color screen)

* [[NLaunch 3.6/3.1]] - Dual-boot your Nspire into both OS 3.6 and 3.1 with this OS switcher. It bypasses all known OS protections on the Nspire. 
  * [[NLaunch 3.2/3.1 |Nspire Nlaunch]] - The legacy version of Nlaunch, for dual-booting 3.2 and 3.1.
* [[PTTKiller]] - No programs here. Just a description of an exploit to defeat Press-to-Test, and instructions for educators to prevent students from using the exploit.
