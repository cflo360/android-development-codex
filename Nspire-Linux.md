### USB Host Keyboard and Mouse

With the advent of the new Ndless version The TI-Nspire is now capable of using a USB Keyboard or mouse, thanks to the BSD USB library used in the OS. However, getting the right kind of connector will be a challenge.

The easy way is just to look for a **miniUSB A Male to USB A Female** cable on eBay for 99 cents. Another way would be to splice your TI-Nspire link cable with a female head, but that's only if you're really cheap.

However, the best way is to get a miniUSB connected USB Hub, and plug your existing TI-Nspire link cable into it, giving not only a connector, but multiple ports for using the keyboard and mouse simultaneously.

If you don't have your TI-Nspire Link Cable, it's just a **miniUSB A Male to miniUSB B Male** cable that you can find easily on eBay.

Afterwards, update to the latest version of Ndless and install the HID drivers. Now using the TI-Nspire can be as easy as on the computer.
