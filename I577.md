---------

1. Download all the required files and get a micro usb cable.
2. Put your phone into Odin mode.
3. With phone in ODIN mode, run Odin.1.85.exe (it's in the folder where you unzipped ODIN too).
4. Odin will launch on your computer. It should show, in the first box under ID:COM, a port in yellow. Mine was Port 5. This means you have successfully connected to your phone.
5. Click the button in ODIN labeled "PDA", and then browse to the .tar file you downloaded above and then select "Open". The file will show up next to the PDA button.
6. Make sure that "Re-Partition" is NOT checked!;
7. Click "Start" and wait till your phone reboots. It should reboot into normal mode. If it doesn't, just power down and reboot into normal mode.
8. Copy the SuperUser.zip file you downloaded above to your phones microSD card.
9. Reboot the phone into recovery mode: While pushing and holding both the vol up and vol down buttons, push the power button. As soon as you see "SAMSUNG" flash, release the buttons. You shouldn't need to have the phone connected to the computer this time. The phone will boot into CWM recovery.
10. Using either: the "menu" button to move down and the "home" button to move your selection up; or alternately the volume down button to move down, and the volume up button to move up: highlight "install zip from sdcard". Use the "search" button or power button to select/enter.
11. Highlight "choose zip from sdcard" and press the "seach" button to select it.
12. Browse to the directory which you copied SuperUser to and select it.
13. Scroll down to "Yes - Install Superuser" and select it.
14. Once done, reboot your phone into normal operating mode.
