The Jelly Bean 4.1.2 OTA Update changes the partition scheme to more closely match the Nexus 4, allowing the use of modified Nexus 4 kernels, which is critical to any modding.

## Method 1: Standard OTA Update

You can go to Settings->General->About Phone->Software Updates on your phone to request an OTA update from AT&T. If you don't get one, you have to wait 24 hours to try again.

## Method 2: LGNPST

If you don't want to wait forever to download the OTA update, you have to use LGNPST to flash the OTA.
