Here is a list of great games and applications that don't require the installation of Ndless.

* (CX) - Best on CX.
* [CX] - CX models only.
* [CAS] - Models with CAS only.
* (MyLib) - Can be placed into the MyLib folder for it's functions to be used in the Scratchpad.
* (Startup) - Might be useful to place into the Startup folder to run it at every boot.
* (File Association) - It's a good idea to associate this program with a certain extension in `ndless.cfg.tns`.

### Math

* **TabVar** (MyLib) - Crazy Calculus functions.
* **solve_triangle** - No more Trigonometry. Just type in a few angles and this program does the rest.
* **Synthetic Division** - Solves complicated algebraic division.
* **Quadratic** (MyLib) - Uses the quadratic formula to solve equations.
* **Units** [non-CAS] - Attempts to bring the constants and unit conversion functions of the TI-Nspire CAS to non-CAS models.

### Chemistry

* **Multiperiodic** - A full periodic table with visuals and additional useful information.
* **Chemistry Library** - a must have for any Chemistry student. Get instant information about any element, and just type in a molecule formula to get it's molar mass. It even balances equations!

### Miscellaneous

* **nSpaint** Portable paint and more with the touchpad, reminiscent of the TI-40. You can even make animations. And now with HIDn, a USB mouse too.
* **Pencil Paint** - A simpler paint program for just a pencil
* **Personal Organizer** - Turn your calculator into a PDA, with calendar, phonebook, and addressbook.
