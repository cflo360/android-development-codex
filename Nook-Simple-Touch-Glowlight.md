## Rooting

### Rooting 1.2.1

* If you bought the nook outside of the US or, you bought the nook after 2012, then it will have 1.2.x on it.
* The best way to root the kindle is to use NookManager

#### Prerequisites
1. A Nook Simple Touch Glowlight
2. A 1gb(or higher) microSD card
3. A microSD card reader
 
- **DO NOT USE THE NOOK AS A CARD READER, IT WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLY BRICK IT**

#### The actual rooting
1. Download [NookManager](http://download.doozan.com/nook/NookManager-0.5.0.zip)
2. Use a disk imager such as Win32DiskImager(only for Windows) or dd to write the file to the sdcard
3. Turn off your nook, and wait for NookManager to start
4. Click "No, continue without wireless"
5. Back up the nook. Click Rescue, then backup and then "Format remaining space on SD card" and finally "Create Backup"
6. This will take a long time, up to 45 minutes
7. Plug your nook into the computer(without exiting NookManager) and copy all the backup files into your computer
8. Click Back twice, and click Root and then root my device
9. Now click Back and Exit
10. Remove the sdcard, and your done!
11. When it boots use the launcher "Relauncher"
